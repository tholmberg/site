Let’s set the scene: You're cruising on an open highway, music blasting, the horizon glowing with the setting sun, and your speedometer quietly suggesting you're a bit beyond what's technically "recommended." Life feels perfect—until that heart-stopping flash from a hidden speed camera or the sudden glare of blue lights in your rearview mirror.

It’s in these moments the idea of building your own speed-detection countermeasures becomes truly enticing. This isn’t about breaking laws—it’s about reclaiming autonomy, pushing the boundaries of personal technology, and dancing in the grey area between compliance and creativity. Welcome to the thrilling, slightly edgy world of radar and laser countermeasures.

## The Grey Area: Legal or Not?

Here’s the awkward truth: while radar detectors are legal in most U.S. states, **active jamming devices**—especially LIDAR jammers—are restricted or outright banned in many jurisdictions. For example, in Colorado, interfering with police radar or laser equipment is illegal, though simply detecting signals generally isn't prohibited.

> **Always check your local laws** before building or deploying any of the devices described here. This guide is intended for educational and experimental purposes only.

That said, the **spirit of this project** is not to promote unsafe or illegal behavior, but to explore the cutting edge of DIY electronics, signal analysis, and the defensive tech used by those who love the open road.

## Why We Build: The Cannonball Inspiration

Consider the legendary *Cannonball Run* — a coast-to-coast driving challenge where elite teams race across the U.S. with military-grade planning and spy-movie tech. One Boston-based team pulled off three runs during the COVID-19 lockdowns, clocking a mind-blowing time of **25 hours and 57 minutes**.

Their success wasn't just about driving skill. It was a masterclass in using:

- Radar detectors & LIDAR jammers
- ADS-B aircraft tracking
- Police scanner networks
- Infrared cameras
- GPS logging & data overlays

It was less about rebellion and more about **strategy, innovation, and outsmarting the system**. That's the ethos we're channeling here.

## Radar vs. LIDAR: Know Your Enemy

### Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging)

- **Bands**: X (~10.5 GHz), K (~24.15 GHz), Ka (~33.4–36 GHz)
- **Function**: Emits wide radio waves; speed calculated via Doppler shift
- **Countermeasure**: Detectors offer good early warning, unless it's "instant-on"

### LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)

- **Precision Targeting**: Pinpointed IR beam aimed at license plates or headlights
- **Function**: Uses time-of-flight of light pulses to measure speed
- **DIY Difficulty**: Narrow beam width = split-second detection and jamming response
- **Combo Threat**: Police often use **both**, so hybrid strategies are best

---

## Building a DIY LIDAR Detector

### Components Required

- **IR Photodiode** (e.g., BPW34)
- **Transimpedance Amplifier** (OPA381 or LM358)
- **Comparator** (LM393)
- **Microcontroller** (ESP32 or Arduino)
- **IR Bandpass Filter** (904 nm recommended)

### Basic Circuit Setup

```text
[ Lens + IR Filter ] → [ Photodiode ] → [ Op-Amp ] → [ Comparator or ADC ] → [ Microcontroller ]
```

### Arduino Sketch (v1.0.0)

```cpp
// DIY LIDAR Detector v1.0.0
// Reads IR pulses and reports to Serial Monitor

const int irPin = A0;       // Analog input from photodiode circuit
int threshold = 512;        // Adjust this based on test environment

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);     // Begin serial communication
}

void loop() {
  int reading = analogRead(irPin);   // Read analog value from IR sensor

  if (reading > threshold) {
    unsigned long now = micros();
    Serial.print("LIDAR Pulse detected at: ");
    Serial.print(now);
    Serial.println(" µs");

    delayMicroseconds(100);  // Basic debounce/delay between pulses
  }
}
```

**Tips for Accuracy**

- Mount behind a grille for a clean, low-profile look with direct line-of-sight
- Use a **narrow-band 904nm IR filter** to limit false triggers

## Advanced Tech: DIY LIDAR Jamming with PWM

Using precise, high-speed pulses, it's possible to disrupt LIDAR targeting. Projects like **NOTCHACOTCHA** showcased this at DEF CON.

### Arduino PWM Jammer (v1.0.0)

```cpp
// LIDAR Jammer v1.0.0
// Emits PWM pulses intended to interfere with LIDAR reception

int laserPin = 4;  // Output pin for IR laser diode

void setup() {
  pinMode(laserPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(laserPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);     // Pulse width (adjust per LIDAR model)
  digitalWrite(laserPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(100);    // Off time between pulses
}
```

**Spoofing Tips**

- Use an oscilloscope and IR receiver to log real LIDAR pulse patterns
- Reverse-engineer known units like **ProLaser III**, **TruSpeed S**
- Use RDForum timing tables to tune your system

> **Note**: Spoofing is an art. Timing matters. Random pulses don’t work—precise interference does.
